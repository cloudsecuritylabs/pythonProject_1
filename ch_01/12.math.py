## integers ##
# 2 + 10
# 10 - 2
# 10 / 5
# 2 * 3

# Python supports the order of operations too
# 3 + 3 * 4

## Floats ##
# any number with a decimal point a float.
# 2.01 + 10.88
# 10.66 - 2.34
# 10.99 / 5.22
# 2.34 * 3.33

# floating calculations may lead to some odd results!
# 0.2 + 0.1
# 3 * .1


# When we divide any two numbers,
# even if they are integers that result in a whole number,
# we get a float:
# 4/2 = 2.0

# mix integer with float --> you get a float


# underscores in numbers
